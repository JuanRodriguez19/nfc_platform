## Hardware

https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pn532-rfid-nfc

## Software
Developed on and for the Broadcom Development Platform(Raspberry Pi)

## Progress
[Project Schedule](temp.com)
### Week 9
PCB has been designed in Eagle and submitted to the prototype lab. Currently reading Beginning NFC by O'Reilly to understand libnfc and software standards.

### Week 10 - November 6th, 2018
Today is the PCB solder milestone. I plan to get my board from the prototype lab and create temporary connections to test if the board is functioning correctly.
I have lots of catching up to do in in this class as I missed the last two. This includes,
- [x] Re-upload budget
- [ ] Week 11 progress report
- [ ] Pickup redesigned board
  * ~~Board is not wide enough and GPIO is hidden under the PN532~~
  * ~~Reduce GPIO's to top 6~~
  * ~~Remove copper plater to reduce shorting chances~~
  * ~~Widen lines to 15mm~~
  * ~~Redo PCB layout~~
- [ ] Cut/short I2C jumpers
- [x] Read the first 3 chapters of "Beginning NFC"
- [x] ~~Purchase stack header pins~~ + ~~add to budget~~
- [x] Add image of PCB
